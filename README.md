# Hello, I'm Blessed

I am actively transitioning into cybersecurity through structured self-study and hands-on home-lab work. My focus areas are network defense, vulnerability assessment, and threat management across Windows and Linux environments. Practical lab work with Wireshark for packet capture and analysis helped me map observed traffic to the OSI model. I have built an Active Directory domain, joined clients, and configured Group Policy to understand endpoint behavior and controls. I also provision and manage cloud VMs (Azure) and connect to instances remotely using SSH for investigation and administration.

## Objective

I am seeking a Tier 1 Analyst role within a Security Operations Center (SOC) where I can apply my lab-tested skills in log and network analysis, incident triage, and automated response while continuing to build operational experience in defending production environments.

## Projects

### Detection Lab

* Built a lab SIEM stack to collect and analyze Windows and Linux logs.
* Implemented detection rules and searches for common attacker techniques.
* Performed network captures with Wireshark and mapped findings to the OSI model to validate detections.

### Endpoint Analysis Lab

* Deployed Wazuh XDR for endpoint telemetry and integrity monitoring.
* Created integrity-check rules and verified endpoint state after configuration changes.
* Built forensic playbooks to interpret integrity alerts and guide triage actions.

### Cloud Lab — Azure

* Provisioned and hardened Azure VMs for attacker emulation and blue-team defensive exercises.
* Connected via SSH for Linux instance administration and remote troubleshooting.
